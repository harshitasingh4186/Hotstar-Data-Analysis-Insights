# Hotstar-Data-Analysis-Insights
This project performs data analysis on Hotstar user data, exploring trends in streaming behavior, content preferences, and user engagement. Implemented in Python (Jupyter Notebook) using a CSV dataset, it includes EDA, data visualization, and predictive analytics to understand key patterns in user interactions with the platform.
<br>
<br>
🔍 Overview:
<br>
This project aims to analyze Hotstar streaming data to uncover user preferences, viewing habits, and content trends. Using Python and data science techniques, it provides insights into how users engage with Hotstar, what genres are most popular, and how content consumption varies over time.
<br>
<br>
📂 Files Included:
<br>
📄 hotstar.csv – A dataset containing user interactions, watch history, and streaming metrics.
<br>
📜 hotstar.ipynb – A Jupyter Notebook implementing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations.
<br>
<br>
🛠 Project Workflow:
<br>
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing & Cleaning 🧹
<br>
